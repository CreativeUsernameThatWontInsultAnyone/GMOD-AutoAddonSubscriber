# GMOD-AutoAddonSubscriber
DISCLAIMER: The autosubber part is not yet implemented. I'm going to post the update in like 12/20 hours. Right now it just generates steamworkshop urls from the provided path.

ALSO IMPORTANT: For now, create urllist.txt, savedlist.txt and addonlist.txt yourself. I'll add the .txt file creation ASAP but for now just bear with me kk?
