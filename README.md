How to use the autosub?
Get your friend to generate their own savedlist.txt using this program. The file is going to appear in the same directory as this program. 
Then you should use the autosubber function to open all the required mods in a webbrowser.

Next, I'll add a feature that will automatically download the files from the workshop if you're logged in.
