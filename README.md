How to use the autosub?
Get your friend to generate their own savedlist.txt using this program. The file is going to appear in the same directory as this program. 
Then you should use the autosubber feature to sub to all the mods.

NOTE: I plan to make this also support Chrome and Chromium in the future. If you're and Edge person then please seek professional help or report yourself to a nearest police station.

Evening | 5/2/2022 - I was unable to get the selenium part to work. I'll get to it tomorrow, I've been working on it for 4 hours now and there is just one freaking bug I need to squash.

Early Morning | 5/8/2022 - Finished. Took me a lot longer than I expected. Loved coding this and I'm glad I got to learn so much about Selenium.

Edit 2022/6/12. Project Deprecated, should still work tho
